Manhattan Distance
The default heuristic I used is not admissible for the 8 tile game.
However if we do not include 0 in the count then it becomes admissible.
Using this admissible heuristic, then the manhattan distance is more informed than the default heuristic.
The default heuristic gives 0 if a tile is in place and 1 if the is out of place.
The manhattan distance also gives 0 if a tile is in place.
But if the tile is out of place it will give a value of at least 1 and a max of 4.
Since this is always greater than or equal to the default heuristic, the manhattan distance is more informed.

Custom Heuristic
This heuristic multiplies the manhattan distance by that tiles distance from the blank tile.
This is a number that will also be between 1 and 4.
So because the numbers of the manhattan distance are being multiplied by a number between 1 and 4.
They will always be greater than or equal to the manhattan distance so it is more informed.
However unlike the other two heuristics it is not admissible.
For example if you take any start state and make any two moves (as long as you don't move the same tile back),
This heuristic will return 3 which is more than the shortest moves which is 2.
Interestingly in the transcripts provided, this heuristic did not find the shortest path, but it did find the path quicker.
What I mean by that is it has fewer nodes in the closed list which means it took fewer iterations to find a goal.
